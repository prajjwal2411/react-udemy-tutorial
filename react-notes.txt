Section 2 - JS Refresher
	2.1 - let & const
			- use let for variables
			- use const for constant values
		- Arrow Functions
			- no need of parenthesis if there is exactly one argument
			- If u r returning only the return statement then, {} & return keyword is not needed
		- Exports & Imports
			- If using default keyword, I,ports default & ONLY export of the file, Name in the receiving file is upto user
			- If not using default keyword, import stuff by using its name.
			- for alias, use as keyword
			- for importing everyting, use * operator
		- Classes
			- blueprint for objects
			- to instantiate a class, use new keyword
			- implement inheritance using extends keyword
			- Use super keyword in derived class, to access inherited constrcutor
		- Classes, Properties & Methods
			- Properties are variables attached to classes/objects
			- Methods are like functions attached to classes/objects
			- ES7 Feature - to initialize a property, we can skip initializing it in the constructor block
			- ES7 Feature - to define a function we can use it as arrow function
			E.g. classMethod = () = {}
		- Spread & Rest Operators
			- ...
			- Spread -> Used to spli array elements OR object properties
			E.g. With Array -> const newArray = [...oldArray, 1, 2]
			E.g. with Object -> const newObject = {..oldObject, newProp: 5}
			- If old object also has newProp property, it will be overwritten
			- Rest -> Used to merge a list of function arguments into an Array
			E.g. function sortArgs(...args){
					return args.sort()
				}
		- Destructuring
			- Easily extract array elements or object properties & store them in variables

		- Reference & Primitive type Refresher
			- Primitive Types
				- numbers, strings, booleans are primitive types
				- When you create a copy of these data types, the controller actually creates a new memory location & assign that location to that variable
			- Reference Types
				- Arrays, Objects & Function are reference types
				- When you define these data types, controller is storing a pointer in the variable & that pointer, points to the memory loc where object is stored, So If you create a copy with new variable, it points to the same location as well.
				- These types creates a mutable copy of themselves
				- To create immutable copy of these types, use spread operator
		- Array Methods
			- map
				- Returns a new array, by performing some functionality on every element of the array
Section 3 - React Basiscs & Working with Components
	3.1 - What are components? & why is react all about them?
			- React is a js lib, for building UI
			- Componets are reusable building blocks, in application's UI
		- React code is written in a declarative way
			- React allows you to create re-usable & reactive components consisting of HTML, JS & CSS
			- Declarative Approach - Define the desired target state(s) & let React figure out the actual JS DOM Instructions
		- Creating a new React Project
			- use npx create-react-app <app-name> to create React project
		- Analyzing a Standard React Project
			- First file to execute is index.js
			- createRoot method creates the main entry point into the react application
			- index.html, is the only html file that is loaded in the browser
